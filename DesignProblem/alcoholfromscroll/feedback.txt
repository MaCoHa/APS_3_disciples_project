## Short summary feedback Summary of problem: 
- Given N drinks, find the drink with the highest alcohol-to-price ratio. 

Suggestions for improvements: 
- Your python submissions are missing shebangs (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`), so verifyproblem throws an error. 
- I'd recommend using single-letter variable names, e.g. `u` for units of alcohol and `p` for price (currency need not be specified). 
- You should specify when using 0-based indexing. In this case, I would not have used indices at all, and have given the drinks unique names instead, making the output be the name of the drink rather than the 0-based index.
- You should specify upper and lower bounds all numbers. 
- Your input format validator does not catch input swith extra text, e.g. `1\n5 6text`. 

## Verdict Passed: Yes
